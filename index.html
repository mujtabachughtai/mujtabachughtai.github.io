        <h1>Muji Chughtai</h1>
        <p>Thanks for visiting my webpage! I am a first-year PhD candidate at Yale University in the Social Psychology area, co-advised by Dr. Margaret Clark and Dr. Maria Gendron. I grew up near Cincinnati, Ohio, and I completed my undergraduate training at The Ohio State University, where I received a bachelor's degree in psychology and a bachelor's degree in statistics. Prior to joining Yale, I worked with Dr. Russ Fazio in Ohio Stateâ€™s Attitudes and Social Cognition Lab to examine the roles of rejection sensitivity and valence weighting biases on emotion perception. Currently, I am interested in incongruent emotion experience and emotion expression, and I am specifically interested in the relationship contexts where these incongruences occur, the motivations for individuals to create these incongruences, and attitudes towards individuals who are known to have this incongruence. Additionally, I am interested in exploring the similarities and differences between attitudes and emotions, such as the link between emotion expression and attitude-based behavior and the link between persuasion and emotion regulation.</p>
